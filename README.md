## About me
Hey everyone and welcome to my profile! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Adam, a PC nerd and also a website developer. My passion is making frontend for many sites, doing graphical stuff or managing large projects under someone else.
In my free time, I play badminton for 5 years or take a walk (teenage things).
