## About me
Hello guys. My name is Adam and I'm frontend developer. I like making new websites. It's something like my second hobby. I also play badminton in a sport way, maybe 3 years from now? I'm doing administration work on BeastBlock.cz, that is a Minecraft project of Nakashi.

I'm  very active on Discord as a `Kl√©ma#2856` or my IG account `@adam__klement`, but it will be better if you send a message on Discord actually.
