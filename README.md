## About me
Hello guys. My name is Adam and I'm a frontend developer. I like making new websites. It's something like my second hobby. I also play badminton in a sporting way, maybe 3 years from now? I'm doing administration work on BeastBlock.cz, which is a Minecraft project of Nakashi.

## Where can I find you?
I'm very active on Discord as a `Kl√©ma#2152` or my IG account `@adam__klement`, but it will be better if you send a message on Discord.

## Why did you remove old repos?
Uugh, they were pretty cringe and also going to make me die from that. Idk, would you leave that public when that repos didn't have any files? Also, I'm not pretty happy to have things on GitHub like my old Discord Bot Maker projects, random projects, etc. Hope you understand that.
